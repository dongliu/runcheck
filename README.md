# Style, linter, and formatter

We use [eslint](http://eslint.org/) for linter and style control. Please use the latest stable eslint release. The eslint config file is `.eslintrc`. The file name format is controlled by [eslint-plugin-filenames](https://github.com/selaux/eslint-plugin-filenames).  

If you are using [sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), there are several plugins that support eslint in the editor: [sublimelinter](http://www.sublimelinter.com/en/latest/), [sublimelinter eslint](https://github.com/roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint), and [eslint formatter](https://github.com/TheSavior/ESLint-Formatter).
